Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and methods as single unit. In this way, variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through methods of their current class.

Using Encapsulation, we can even keep track of the changes and make sure our data is safe. The encapsulated code is more flexible and easy to modify with new requirements. It prevents other class to access private data.

To achieve Encapsulation, we need to declare the instance variables of the class as private and also provide public getters and setters in the class to set/modify the values of variables.
